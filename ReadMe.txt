An extension of lms5 (CustomUser - register, login, logout, password change/rest.)

In this app, I'll try to re-structure the folder setup, double check CustomUser is set up correctly.

This app was originally based on the series of tutorials by SuperCoder ("Python Django Student Management System, https://youtu.be/y3llbdTtam4). One version can be found on GitHub: https://github.com/hackstarsj

Informed by: https://testdriven.io/blog/django-custom-user-model/

This app was originally an exercise in setting up CustomUser.
